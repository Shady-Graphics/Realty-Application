Realty-Application
==================

This is a database driven application for a made up property agent

This is a java application with a mysql database attached.
This application requires some configuration. 

In the project folder there is a sql file containing the database, this needs to be imported into your localhost server.**

If you are importing it into another server the url in each java file will need to be changed to match the new location of the database (not the recomended method).

** note: please check the url in each file matches your local setup i.e. check the urls in each java file.
